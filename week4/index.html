        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <li>Forms are made up of a ~form~ element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</li>pter.
        <li>Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would be sent to a server where the information would be processed using a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby. It's possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript.</li>
        <form name='search' action='/search'>
            <input type='text' name='searchInput'>
            <button type='submit'>Search</button>
        </form>
        <p>The property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. </p>
        <p>A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form.</p>
        <p>We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form object.</p>
        <li>Form Events
            <p>Submit, submits the forms</p>
            <p>Reset, resets the form to initial values. Reset buttons are considered poor as they erase everything on the value.</p>
            <p>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it's sent to a different URL to be processed on the server</p>
        </li>
        <li>Forms have several events, some of which are exclusive to them
            <p>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an ~input~ element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).</p>
            <p>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</p>
            <p>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won't fire, but the blur event will.</p>
            <p>The submit event usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it's sent by adding a submit event listener.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form
            <p>Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field. We can use this to report back what the user has searched for. </p>
        </li>
        <li>It's also possible to set the value using JavaScript.</li>
        <li><h3>Form Controls</h3></li>

            <label for='heroName'>Name:

                <select name='city' id='city'>
                    <option value='' selected>Choose a City</option>

            <label for='origin'>Origin Story:
                <textarea id='origin' name='origin' rows='20' cols='60'></textarea>

            <button type='button'>Click Me</button>
            <button type='reset'>Reset</button>
            <button type='submit' id='submit' disabled>Submit</button>
        </form>
        <p>The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads.</p>
        <p>The placeholder attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text. This can be useful to place hints about how to fill in the form.</p>
        <p>The maxlength attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value given</p>
        <ol>Input Fields
            <li>Text Input Fields - for text such as username. The type='text' attribute isn't required, but it is advisable to use it as it makes the intended purpose of the field explicit, helping with maintenance, readability and future-proofing.</li>
            <li>Password Input Fields - input type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information. This works in the same way as an input field with type='text', except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they're unable to be read on the screen.</li>
            <li>Checkbox Input Fields -  type='checkbox'. They are used to select different options that can be checked (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can select more than one checkbox from a list.<br> Rule of thumb, all similar form controls should have a similar name property so they be accessed as an HTML collection.<br>
                hero.powers = [...form.powers].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value);<br>
                This uses the spread operator to turn the node list into an array. This then allows us to use the filter() method that returns an array containing only the check boxes that were checked (this is because their 'checked' property will be truthy). We then chain the map() method to the end, which replaces each checkbox in the array with its 'value' property. This array is then returned and stored in the hero.powers variable.<br></li>
            <h4>Manipulating forms using the DOM</h4>
                <p>document.forms.hero.powers[0].checked = true;<br>
                Checkboxes can also be checked initially using the 'checked' attribute in the HTML:<br>
                <input type='checkbox' value='Flight' name='powers' checked></p>
            <li>Radio Button Input Fields - Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio'. Like checkboxes they allow users to check an option as true, but they provide an exclusive choice of options, so only one option can be selected. Just like checkboxes, radio buttons should have the same 'name' attribute of 'category'. This is used to group them together â€• only one radio button can be checked in a group that has the same name attribute.<br>
                Each radio button has a 'checked' property that returns the boolean values true and false, depending on if it has been selected or not. It's possible to change the 'checked' property to true using JavaScript, but because only one radio button can be checked at once, all the others with the same 'name' property will change to false. So the following line of code would check the 'antihero' radio button, but the 'hero' and 'villain' radio buttons would then be unchecked:<br>
                form.type[2].checked = true;</li>
            <li>Hidden Input Fields - Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden'. These are not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided.<br>
                Shouldn't be used for sensitive data.</li>
            <li>File Input Fields - A file input field can be created using input fields with type='file'. These are used to upload files, and most browsers will provide a browse button or similar that lets users select a file from their file system.</li>
            <li>Other Input Types - There are lots of new input types included in HTML5, such as number, tel and color. As browsers start to support these, they will implement different user-interface elements depending on the input type. So a number field might use a slider, whereas a date field will show a calendar. They will also validate automatically, so an email input field will show an error message if there's no valid email address.<br>
                Number input fields also have optional 'min' and 'max' attributes that can be used to limit the input given.</li>
            <li>Select Drop-Down List - Select drop-down lists can be used to select one or more options from a list of values. The 'multiple' attribute is required if more than one option is to be selected. Note that the 'selected' attribute can be used to set the initial value in the HTML. In this example, the blank option that provides the instructional message 'Choose a City' has this attribute, so it's shown when the page loads.</li>
            <li>Text Areas - A ~textarea~ element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog post. They work in much the same way as input fields. We access them using the 'name' attribute, and use the value property to see what text was entered.</li>
            <li>Buttons - The default botton type is 'submit', another type is reset (this not recommended). The other type is simply 'button'. This doesn't need to be inside a form element and has no default behavior. It simply creates a clickable button that can have an event listener attached to it.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Form Validation
            <p>Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data before it's saved to a database. This is because it's possible for a user to modify the JavaScript code and bypass the validation rules. It's also very easy to bypass the front-end completely and send arbitrary data to the application's backend. For these reasons, JavaScript validation should be used to enhance the user experience when filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before it's submitted.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A required field is completed</li>
                <li>An email address is valid</li>
                <li>A number is entered when numerical data is required</li>
                <li>A password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
            </ol>
            <p>HTML5 has it's own validation API, this can be customized using JS</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Disabling the Submit Button
            <p>The technique that can aid usability is to disable the submit button if there are errors on the form.</p>
        </li>
        <h3>Object Oriented Programming - OPP</h3>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program.</p>
        <li>Encapsulation - he inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user</li>
        <li>Polymorphism - the same process can be used for different objects</li>
        <li>Inheritance - taking the features of one object then adding some new features.</li>
        <li>Classes - class-based languages use a class to define a blueprint for an object, eg Java and Ruby. Javascript before ES6 used actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects. This is known as a prototype-based language.</li>
        <p class="red">Even though ES6 now supports classes, it still uses this prototypal inheritance model in the background.</p>
        <p>This is done using constructor function - a function that defines the properties and methods of an object.</p>
        <li>Built-In Constructor Functions - Object, Array, and Function
            <ol>
                <li>The easiest way to create a new object is to use the literal syntax: const literalObject = {}; <span class="red">A literal is still considered to be an instance of the Object constructor: literalObject instanceof Object; ~true</span></li>
                <li>The easiest way to create an array is to use the literal syntax, like so: const literalArray = [1,2,3];</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>ES6 Class Declarations - ES6 introduced the new class declaration syntax that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function, but looks much similar to writing a class in a class-based programming language.</li>
        <p class="red">The ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function syntax because they are more succinct, easier to read and all code in a class definition is implicitly in strict mode, so doesn't need the 'use strict' statement</p>
        <li>The Constructor Property</li>
        <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
        <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality. </p>
        <p class="red">Not everything in the module needs to be used.</p>
        <li>Coupling<br>
            The coupling of code refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code are on each other. Two pieces of code are said to be tightly coupled if one relies on the other to run. This often occurs if a piece of code makes hard-coded references to another piece of code, requiring it to be used. 
        </li>
        <li>ES6 Modules - important notes<br>
            <ol>
                <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' </li>
                <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
                <li>The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than the global object.</li>
                <li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Node.js Modules - Node.js had already implemented modules before they were introduced in ES6, and used a slightly different notation called Common JS modules.<br>
            module.exports = x =>  x * x;</li>
