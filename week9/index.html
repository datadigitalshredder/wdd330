        <h3>The window Object - JavaScript - Novice to Ninja</h3>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM)<br>
            The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.
        <p>Global Variables - These are variables that are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.</p>  
        <p>Three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). These are not part of the ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as methods of the window object.</p>
        <p>Browser Information<br>
            The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used.<br>
            Don’t rely on this information though, as it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser. It can also be difficult to make any sense of the string returned, because all browsers pretend to be others to some degree.</p>
        <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</p>
        <p>This property (as well as most of the others in this section) is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment. If this is done, the page will be reloaded using the new property. F</p>
        <p>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end:</p>
        <p>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used):</p>
        <p>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</p>
        <p>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</p>
        <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:</p>
        <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters.</p>
        <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier:</p>
        <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed:</p>
        <p>The window.location object also has the following methods:<br>
            The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.<br>    
            The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter<br>
            The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.<br>
            The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL
        </p>
        <p>The Browser History<br>
            The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API. (See http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-history-pushstate/ post for details.)<br>
            The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.<br>
            The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</p>
        <p>Controlling Windows<br>
            A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code</p>
        <p>The close() method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it:</p>
        <p>It is also possible to move a window using the window.moveTo() method. This takes two parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved to:</p>    
        <p>You can resize a window using the window.resizeTo() method. This takes two parameters that specify the width and height of the resized window’s dimensions</p>
        <p>Screen Information<br>
            The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively<br>
            The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus</p>
        <p>The Document Object<br>
            Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
        <p>
            The document.write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will completely replace the current document:</p>
        <p>The use of document.write() is heavily frowned upon as it can only be realistically used by mixing JavaScript within an HTML document. There are still some extremely rare legitimate uses of it, but a ninja programmer will hardly ever need to use it.</p>
        <p>Cookies<br>
            Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.</p>
        <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property</p>
        <p>The document.cookie property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won’t overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string. So we can add more cookies by assigning them to document.cookie</p>
        <p>Timing Functions<br>
            The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the following example into a console. It should show an alert dialog after three seconds (that’s 3000 milliseconds)<br>
            window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000);<br>
            Notice that the method returns an integer. This is an ID used to reference that particular timeout. It can also cancel the timeout using the window.clearTimeout() method. Try calling the code again and make a note of the number that is returned:<br>
            window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000);<br>
            setInterval()<br>
            The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>Animation<br>
            The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. As an example, let’s create a web page that shows a colored square, and make it rotate.</p>
        <p>requestAnimationFrame<br>
            This method of the window object works in much the same way as the window.setInterval() method, although it has a number of improvements to optimize its performance. These include making the most of the browser’s built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance. It’s supported in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer from version 10 onwards. </p>
        <p>CSS animation<br>
            <span class="red">In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.</span></p>

        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <p>HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the specification.</p>
        <li>The data- attribute<br>
            The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. <br>
            The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:

            <ol><li>Start with data-.</li>
            <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
            <li>Include an optional string value.</li></ol>
        </li>
        <p>HTML5 APIs<br>
            The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</p>
        <li>HTML5 Web Storage<br>
            The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.</li>
            The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:

            <ol><li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
                <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
                <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>
                <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li></ol>

        </li>
        <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session.</p>
        <li>Geolocation<br>
            The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.</li>
        <li>Web Workers<br>
            We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message that occurs when a script runs for too long</li>
        <div><a href="factors.html">Web workers - Factorization example</a></div>
        <li>Websockets<br>
            Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</li>
        <li>Notifications<br>
            The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.</li>
        <li>Multimedia<br>
            HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.<br>
                <audio src='/song.mp3' controls>
                    Your browser does not support the audio element.
                </audio>
                <video src='http://movie.mp4' controls>
                    Your browser does not support the video element.
                </video>
                Audio and video elements have a number of properties and methods to control the playback of the clip.
                <li>play</li>
                <li>pause</li>
                <li>volume</li>
                <li>muted</li>
                <li>current time</li>
                <li>playbackRate</li>
                <li>loop</li>
                <li>duration</li>
        </li>
        <li>Other APIs<br>
            The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for accessing a device’s camera, uploading files, accessing the battery status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more!
            <ol><li>Drawing in Canvas</li>
                <canvas id='canvas' width='400' height='400'>Sorry, but your browser does not support the canvas element</canvas>
            <li>Shims and Polyfills<br>
                These are libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the necessary code that's not provided natively by the user’s browser.</li></ol>
