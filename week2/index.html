    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2 class="notes-header">Notes - Basic programming</h2>
    <p class="notes"><li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities
        with the C programming language. It's considered best practice to combine the two and write each 
        statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:
            <ol>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The other data type is object, which includes, arrays, functions and object literals.
        </li>
        <li>The typeof operator is used in Javascript to find the type of value. Eg, <br>
            console.log(typeof 10);<br>
            ~ number<br>
            console.log(typeof false);<br>
            ~ boolean<br>
            console.log(typeof { ninja: 'turtle' });<br>
            ~ object
        </li>
        <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory. <br>
            <strong>VARIABLES MUST be declared before they are used.</strong>  
        </li>
        <li>From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords <em>const</em> and <em>let</em> to declare variables. The 
            keyword <em>const</em> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas 
            <em>let</em> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.<br>
            Assignment is done using the "=" operator.<br>
            Variables can be declared and assigned multiple at the same time separated with commas:<br>
            let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;<br>
            Variables that have been declared using the let keyword can be reassigned to another value at some point 
            later in the program. Eg, <br>
            let points = 25;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 25<br>
            points = 40;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 40<br>
        </li>
    </p>
    <p class="questions">Questions:
        <ol>
            <li>How can use JS to create two elements which will need to be appended to one child? That is having a 
                link description that is followed by the reference. This is for the portfolio build exercise.
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between textContent and innerHTML?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between the var and let keywords and which one should we use?</li>
            <li>On team groups, do I just pick from the discussion (that can be difficult) or the instructor will
                do the assignments?
            </li>
        </ol>
