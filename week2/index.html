    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2 class="notes-header">Notes - Basic programming</h2>
    <p class="notes"><li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities
        with the C programming language. It's considered best practice to combine the two and write each 
        statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:
            <ol>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The other data type is object, which includes, arrays, functions and object literals.
        </li>
        <li>The typeof operator is used in Javascript to find the type of value. Eg, <br>
            console.log(typeof 10);<br>
            ~ number<br>
            console.log(typeof false);<br>
            ~ boolean<br>
            console.log(typeof { ninja: 'turtle' });<br>
            ~ object
        </li>
        <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory. <br>
            <strong>VARIABLES MUST be declared before they are used.</strong>  
        </li>
        <li>From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords <em>const</em> and <em>let</em> to declare variables. The 
            keyword <em>const</em> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas 
            <em>let</em> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.<br>
            Assignment is done using the "=" operator.<br>
            Variables can be declared and assigned multiple at the same time separated with commas:<br>
            let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;<br>
            Variables that have been declared using the let keyword can be reassigned to another value at some point 
            later in the program. Eg, <br>
            let points = 25;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 25<br>
            points = 40;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 40<br>
        </li>
        <li>In contrast, using <em>const</em>means you can't reassign the variable to another value.</em></li>
        <li>Using <em>const</em> does not it immutable when working with non-primitive data types, for example: <br>
            const name = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object <br>
            name.value = 'Siri'; // change the value <br>
            ~ Siri</li>
        <li>The <em>const</em> variabel should be used to declare most variables. This helps to prevent bugs from 
            reassigning the varibles unexpectedly</li>
        <li>let and const have block scope.</li>
        <li>A core tenet of the JavaScript language is that it has to remain backwardly compatible. This 
            means that the behavior of var had to remain consistent, so couldn't just be changed in ES6. For 
            that reason, the new keyword let was introduced.</li>
        <li>Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists 
            inside the block they are declared in.</li>
        <li>Scope refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program.</li>
        <li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is 
            accessible everywhere in the program. NOT a good approach.</li>
        <li>In ES6, blocks can be used to create a local scope. This means that any variables defined inside a block 
            using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that 
            block.</li>
    </p>
    <p class="questions">Questions:
        <ol>
            <li>How can use JS to create two elements which will need to be appended to one child? That is having a 
                link description that is followed by the reference. This is for the portfolio build exercise.
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between textContent and innerHTML?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between the var and let keywords and which one should we use?</li>
            <li>On team groups, do I just pick from the discussion (that can be difficult) or the instructor will
                do the assignments?
            </li>
        </ol>
