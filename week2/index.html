    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2 class="notes-header">Notes - Basic programming</h2>
    <p class="notes"><li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities
        with the C programming language. It's considered best practice to combine the two and write each 
        statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:
            <ol>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The other data type is object, which includes, arrays, functions and object literals.
        </li>
        <li>The typeof operator is used in Javascript to find the type of value. Eg, <br>
            console.log(typeof 10);<br>
            ~ number<br>
            console.log(typeof false);<br>
            ~ boolean<br>
            console.log(typeof { ninja: 'turtle' });<br>
            ~ object
        </li>
        <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory. <br>
            <strong>VARIABLES MUST be declared before they are used.</strong>  
        </li>
        <li>From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords <em>const</em> and <em>let</em> to declare variables. The 
            keyword <em>const</em> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas 
            <em>let</em> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.<br>
            Assignment is done using the "=" operator.<br>
            Variables can be declared and assigned multiple at the same time separated with commas:<br>
            let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;<br>
            Variables that have been declared using the let keyword can be reassigned to another value at some point 
            later in the program. Eg, <br>
            let points = 25;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 25<br>
            points = 40;<br>
            console.log(points);<br>
            ~ 40<br>
            <strong>Local Scope examples</strong><br>
            const a = 1;<br>
            
            { const a = 3;<br>
              a; <br>
              console.log(a);<br>
              ~ 3<br>
            }<br>
            console.log(a);<br>
            ~ 1<br>
            <p>In the example, a is initially defined globally outside the block and is given the value of 1. This 
                means it has global scope and is available inside and outside the block. But then a is defined inside 
                the local block using let. This gives it local scope inside the block where it has a value of 3, but 
                it retains the value of 1 outside the block. For all intents and purposes, the two a variables are 
                different variables.</p>

            let b = 2;<br>
            { b = 4; <br>
            b; <br>
            console.log(b);<br>
            ~ 4<br>
            }<br>
            console.log(b);<br>
            ~ 4<br>
            <p>In this example, b is defined globally outside the block and given the value of 2. Then we reassign the 
                value of b to 4 inside the block, but without using let. This means that it still refers to the global 
                variable outside the block, so the value of b is the same both inside and outside the block and it 
                gets overwritten globally to be a value of 4.</p>

            { c = 5; <br>
              c; <br>
            }<br>
            console.log(c);<br>
            ~ 5<br>
            <p>In this example, c is defined inside the block, but because this is done without using let or const, it 
                has global scope and is also available outside the block.</p>

            { const d = 6; d; }<br>
            console.log(d);<br>
            ~ ReferenceError: d is not defined<br>
            <p>In this example, d is defined inside the block, but by using const so it has local scope and is only 
                accessible inside the block. When we try to log the value of d outside the block, it causes an error 
                because d is not defined globally.</p>
            <p><em>Using let or const to declare variables will ensure they are block scoped, and it is good practice 
                to always use them to declare variables. In general, if a value is unlikely to change in your code 
                then you should declare it using const, and let should only be used for storing values that will need 
                to be reassigned while the program is running.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Direct Assignment and Assignment By Reference<br>
            <em>Direct assignement</em><br>
            const a = 1;<br>
            let b = a;<br> ~ a = 1, b = 1<br>
            <p>In the example above, a references the primitive number 1. We then assign b to the same value as a. At 
                this point a and b both have the same value of 1. Then we reassign the value of 2 to b, but the a 
                still has a value of 1.</p>

            b = 2;<br> ~ a = 1, b = 2<br>
            <em>Assignment by reference</em><br>
            const c = { value: 1 };<br>
            let d = c;<br> ~ c.value = 1, d.value = 1<br>
            d.value = 2;<br> ~ c.value = 2, d.value = 2<br>
            <p>In the example above, the change to the value property of d also results in the value property of c 
                changing as well. This is because the variables c and d are both referencing the same object, so any 
                changes to one of them will also affect the other.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Strings<br>
            new String("hello")<br>
            [String: 'hello']<br>
        </li>
        <li>String Properties and Methods<br>
        <p>Primitive data types and objects have properties and methods. Properties are information about the object 
            or value, while methods perform an action on the object or value â€• either to change it or to tell us 
            something about it.</p>
        <p><em>We can access the properties of a string using dot notation. This involves writing a dot followed by 
            the property we are interested in. For example, every string has a length property that tells us how many 
            characters are in the string:</em></p>
            const name = 'Alexa'; // declare and assign a variable<br>
            ~ 'Alexa'<br>
            
            name.length; // retrieve the name variable's length property<br>
            ~ 5<br>
            <p>All properties of primitive data types are immutable, meaning they're unable to be changed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Converting Strings to Numbers<br>
            Number('23');<br>
            const answer = '5' * 1;<br>
            const answer = +'5';<br>
        </li>
        <li>Converting Numbers to Strings<br>
            String(3);<br>
            3 +'';<br>
            10..toString();<br>
            10..toString(2);<br>
            parseInt('23',10); // 23 is the string to convert to a number in base 10<br>
            parseInt('2.4',10);<br>
            parseFloat('2.9',10);<br>
        </li>
        <li>In contrast, using <em>const</em>means you can't reassign the variable to another value.</em></li>
        <li>Using <em>const</em> does not it immutable when working with non-primitive data types, for example: <br>
            const name = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object <br>
            name.value = 'Siri'; // change the value <br>
            ~ Siri</li>
        <li>The <em>const</em> variabel should be used to declare most variables. This helps to prevent bugs from 
            reassigning the varibles unexpectedly</li>
        <li>let and const have block scope.</li>
        <li>A core tenet of the JavaScript language is that it has to remain backwardly compatible. This 
            means that the behavior of var had to remain consistent, so couldn't just be changed in ES6. For 
            that reason, the new keyword let was introduced.</li>
        <li>Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists 
            inside the block they are declared in.</li>
        <li>Scope refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program.</li>
        <li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is 
            accessible everywhere in the program. NOT a good approach.</li>
        <li>In ES6, blocks can be used to create a local scope. This means that any variables defined inside a block 
            using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that 
            block.</li>
    </p>
    <p class="questions">Questions:
        <ol>
            <li>How can use JS to create two elements which will need to be appended to one child? That is having a 
                link description that is followed by the reference. This is for the portfolio build exercise.
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between textContent and innerHTML?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between the var and let keywords and which one should we use?</li>
            <li>On team groups, do I just pick from the discussion (that can be difficult) or the instructor will
                do the assignments?
            </li>
