    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <h2 class="notes-header">Notes - localStorage</h2>
    <p class="notes"><li>The book, Doing stuff with Web things, uses the var keyword instead of let when 
        declaring variables. The main difference is scoping rules. Variables declared by var keyword are scoped 
        to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) while let variables are scoped to the immediate 
        enclosing block denoted by { } (hence the block scope). Which key word to use is highly opinionated and 
        for the purposes of web development tract at BYU-I we will be using the let keyword.</li>
        <li>When you want to get the user's input from any input or text area tag, you use the special word
            'value'. When you want to show something to a user, you use a section and the special
            word 'innerHTML.' So...if your dealing with an input or textarea use value; a section, use innerHTML.</li>
        <li>Converting JavaScript to English: let storyHTML = document.getElementById('story_editor').value; this is
            read as “Hey document, go get the element who's id is 'story_editor'. Take what you find inside it,
            its value, and store what you find in a variable (box) named 'storyHTML'.” The trick is to read all of 
            the stuff on the right-hand side of the = sign first. By the way, that's the stuff the computer will do 
            first.
        </li>
        <li>Local storage: a good App my always remember what the user likes/prefers. This is accomplished by local
            storage. Local storage uses key:value pairs. Example, <br>
            let storyName = document.getElementById('name_input').value; <br>
            let storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(storyName); <br>
            document.getElementById('story_editor').value = storyHTML; <br>
            This is to say,"Hey local-Storage, get the item stored using what's in the storyName variable 
            as a key. Put the story you find in a variable called 'storyHTML', the value." <br>

    <p class="questions">Questions:
        <ol>
            <li>How can use JS to create two elements which will need to be appended to one child? That is having a 
                link description that is followed by the reference. This is for the portfolio build exercise.
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between textContent and innerHTML?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between the var and let keywords and which one should we use?</li>
            <li>On team groups, do I just pick from the discussion (that can be difficult) or the instructor will
                do the assignments?
            </li>
