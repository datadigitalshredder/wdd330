        <h3>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions - HTML5 and CSS for the Real World</h3>
        <p>Transforms<br>
            The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/(or) skew any element on the page with ease.
            <li>Translation<br>
                Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.</li>
                Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to our span<br> 
            <li>Scaling
                The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as you’d expect<br>
                A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other words, the element’s center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change. To change this default behavior, you can include the transform-origin property, which we’ll be covering a bit later.<br>
                <span class="red">It’s also worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow. This means that if you scale inline-block elements, text around it will fail to accommodate it with reflowing.</span><br>
                In cases where this is an issue, you may consider adjusting the element’s height, width, or font-size instead of using a scale() transform.
            </li>
            <li>Rotation<br>
                The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns</li>
            <li>Skewing<br>
                The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns</li>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the Origin of the Transform<br>
            You can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property. It has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).<br>
            Let’s say that you were transforming a circle. Because the default transform-origin is the center of the circle, applying a rotate() transform to a circle would have no visible effect—a circle rotated 90 degrees still looks exactly the same as it did before being rotated. An ellipse rotated 180 degrees around its center would also look the same as it did before being rotated upside down. However, if you gave your circle or ellipse a transform-origin of 10% 10% or top center, you would notice the rotation.<br>
            <span class="red">The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis.</span><br>
            While CSS3 transforms are unsupported in IE before version 9, you can mimic these effects with other CSS properties, including filters. To mimic translation use position: relative;, and top and left values
        </p>
        <p>Transitions<br>
            Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear smoother.<br>
            <span class="red">CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element.</span>
            <li>The transition-property<br>
                The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.<br>
                Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid midpoint can be transitioned. For example, in transitioning from a 1px red border to a 15px blue border, we transition the color and width of the border. The midpoint of 1px and 15px is obvious (8px), so we know that is a transitionable property value. The midpoint between red and blue might not seem obvious, but the browser converts named colors to their numeric values, which have a midpoint. If the border-style were declared as changing from solid to dashed, that would not be a transitionable property as there is no midpoint between these key terms.<br>
                <span class="red">It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state. For example, to transition from rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original state to border-radius: 0;.</span><br>
                To support older WebKit browsers, you need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties. You may also need to specify the -webkit- prefixed forms of properties. For example, you’re unable to animate transform in a browser that only understands -webkit-transform.<br>
                In itself, the transition-property property has no effect; that’s because we still need to specify the duration of the transition.</li>  
            <li>The transition-duration Property<br>
                The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.

            </li> 
            <li>The transition-timing-function Property<br>
                The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. Do you want your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some other variation?<br>
                The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out. The default ease has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends slowly. ease-in-out is similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the beginning. linear creates a transition that animates at a constant speed.<br>
            </li> 
            <li>The transition delay function<br>
                Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.<br>
                We don’t want our transition to start immediately, because that might be a bad user experience if the user accidentally mouses through our ad on the way from one part of the document to the next. A 50ms delay is enough time to wait to be sure they are intentionally hovering over our advertisement</li>  
            <li>Multiple Transitions<br>
                The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example, if we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.<br>
                Let’s say instead of just transitioning the rotation, we transition the text’s color property as well. We’d have to first include a color property in the transitioned style declaration, and then either add the color property in the transition-property value list, or use the key term all</li>
        </p>
        <p>Animations<br>
            CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.
            <li>Keyframes<br>
                A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. With CSS transitions, we’re essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe. CSS animations allow us to add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more complex ways.<br>
            <span>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block. Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an element, you’ll need to associate the animation with that element.</span></li>
            <li>Animation Properties<br>
            <ol>
                <li>animation-name</li>
                <li>animation duration</li>
                <li>animation-timing-function<br>
                    Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. The options are the same as for transition-timing-function: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function, step-start, step-end, or a developer-defined number of steps with the steps(number, direction) function</li>
                <li>animation-iteration-count<br>
                    The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through. The value is generally an integer, but you can also use numbers with decimal points (in which case, the animation will end partway through an iteration), or the value infinite for endlessly repeating animations. If omitted, it will default to 1, in which case the animation will occur only once. The following is an example of using this property</li>
                <li>animation-direction</li>
                <li>animation-delay</li>
                <li>The Shorthand animation Property<br>
                    Fortunately, there’s a shorthand for all of these animation properties, especially since we’re still including the -webkit- prefix. The animation property takes as its value a space-separated list of values for the longhand animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state properties</li>
                    .verbose {<br>
                        animation-name: appearDisappear; <br>
                        animation-duration: 300ms; <br>
                        animation-timing-function: ease-in;<br>
                        animation-iteration-count: 1;<br>
                        animation-direction: alternate;<br>
                        animation-delay: 5s;<br>
                        animation-fill-mode: backwards;<br>
                        animation-play-state: running;<br>
                    }
                    
                    /* shorthand */<br>
                    .concise {<br>
                        animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;<br>
                    }<br>
                </ol></li>
        </p>
        <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop - HTML5 and CSS for the Real World</h3>
        <p>Canvas<br>
            With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.

        <li>Creating a canvas Element</li>
        <p>SVG<br>
            Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down. </p>
        <p>Drag and Drop<br>
            This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
