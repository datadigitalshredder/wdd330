        <h3>Testing and Debugging - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
        <p>A programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify and deal with them quickly.</p>
        <li>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
            <ol>Causes of errors:
                <li>System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
                <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
                <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            </ol>
            As programmers, we often have little influence over how external systems work, so it can be difficult to fix the root cause of system errors. Despite this, we should still be aware of them and attempt to reduce their impact by working around any problems they cause.
